## AI & Cybersecurity Projects & Research Artifacts

This section highlights my peer-reviewed research publications in AI and cybersecurity, focusing on practical security challenges informed by real-world systems and data. The work emphasizes problem formulation, empirical analysis, and validated insights, without exposing proprietary implementations.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Top-Tier Research Papers**: Publications at leading venues such as ACM CCS, SIGMOD, SAC, and CoLLAs
- **AI for Cybersecurity**: Studies on phishing detection, user behavior analytics, credential exposure, and threat intelligence
- **Privacy-Preserving & Federated Learning**: Research addressing secure, communication-efficient, and non-IID distributed learning
- **Data Quality & Robust Evaluation**: Analyses of annotation errors, label noise, and their impact on model reliability and security decisions
- **Industry-Informed Research**: Problem settings motivated by large-scale, real-world security environments, abstracted to respect confidentiality

Each publication distills generalizable insights and lessons learned from applied research, contributing to both academic understanding and practical security decision-making.
