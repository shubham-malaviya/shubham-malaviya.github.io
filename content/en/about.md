  Currently based in Pune, India, I'm deepening my skills in **Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** 🤖. I work with **Python** 🐍, **PyTorch** , **transformers** , etc. to build intelligent systems that bridge the gap between engineering and data science.

passion_title: "What I'm passionate about"
passion_text: >-
  I’m passionate about building robust, scalable AI systems that perform reliably under real-world constraints such as noisy data, limited labels, privacy requirements, and distributed settings. My interests focus on data-centric AI, efficient model adaptation, and trustworthy evaluation, where system design choices have a direct impact on performance, reliability, and deployment at scale. I’m particularly motivated by turning research insights into production-ready AI pipelines that balance accuracy, efficiency, and operational feasibility.
