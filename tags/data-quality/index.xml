&lt;p&gt;This paper tackles a fundamental but often overlooked problem in modern AI pipelines: annotation errors and their cascading impact on model training, evaluation, and human-in-the-loop data cleaning systems. &lt;br&gt;
We show that annotation error detection (AED) systems themselves break down under label noise, and that simple noise-aware training strategies can dramatically improve their effectiveness without changing model architectures or workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unmasking Label Errors: Why Cybersecurity Benchmarks Need Stronger Benchmarks</title><link>/engineering/label_error_ccs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/engineering/label_error_ccs/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="-what-if-your-benchmark-is-wrong-and-your-best-model-only-looks-good-because-of-it"&gt;🧪 What if your benchmark is wrong and your best model only looks good because of it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work exposes a critical but underappreciated issue in cybersecurity research: annotation errors in benchmark datasets, particularly in evaluation (test) splits. The study shows that even modest label noise can severely distort model rankings, evaluation metrics, and research conclusions.&lt;br&gt;
By carefully curating a widely used CTI dataset and re-evaluating modern language models, this work argues for a fundamental shift toward robust, community-validated cybersecurity benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
